# BASICS PHYTON
Creating Python basics refers to the fundamental skills and knowledge required to develop simple programs or scripts using the Python programming language. This typically includes understanding basic syntax, data types, control structures (such as loops and conditional statements), functions, and how to work with variables and data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc. Additionally, it involves learning how to use built-in functions and libraries, handling errors, and writing clean and efficient code. Overall, mastering the basics of Python programming is essential for anyone looking to start their journey in software development or data science using Python.

DATA TYPES IN PHYTON (DTP)
In Python, data types are a way to classify and represent the type of values or information that can be stored and processed by a program. Each value in Python has a specific data type that determines the nature and operations that can be performed on that value.

1. String
2. Number
1) Integer
2) Float
3) Complex
3. Boolean
4. List
5. Tuple
6. Slicing
7. Set
8. Union
9. Intersection
10. Dictionary
CREATING PHYTON OPERATORS (CPO)
Creating Python operators refers to defining custom operators in Python. While Python comes with a set of built-in operators such as arithmetic, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators, sometimes you may need to define your own custom operators for specific use cases.

Python allows you to define custom operators using special methods called magic methods or dunder methods. These methods have double underscores (__) before and after their names. For example, to define a custom addition operator for a class, you can implement the add() method.

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Root
Floating
Division
Modulo
CONDITIONAL EXPRESSION
In Python, conditional formatting typically refers to the process of applying specific formatting styles or actions based on certain conditions being met. While conditional formatting is commonly associated with spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel, you can achieve similar functionality in Python using various libraries or techniques depending on the context.

Conditional Statement
You can use conditional statements such as if, elif, and else to execute different blocks of code based on specified conditions. Within these blocks, you can include code to format output or perform specific actions.

1. If
In Python, the if statement is a fundamental part of control flow that allows you to conditionally execute code based on specified conditions. The if statement evaluates a condition and, if the condition is true, it executes a block of code associated with it. If the condition is false, the code block associated with the if statement is skipped.

2. Elif
elif stands for "else if". It is part of the if control structure used to evaluate multiple conditions sequentially. If the if condition is not met, then the next elif condition will be evaluated. If any elif condition is met, the associated code block will be executed, and the evaluation will stop. If no if or elif conditions are met, the code block in the else section (if present) will be executed.

3. Else
In Python, the else statement is used in conjunction with the if statement to define a block of code that executes when the if condition evaluates to False. It provides an alternative code block to execute when the condition of the if statement is not met.

NESTED LOOPS
Nested loops in Python, including nested for loops, refer to the concept of placing one loop inside another loop. This means that each iteration of the outer loop triggers all iterations of the inner loop. By using nested for loops, you can iterate through combinations of two or more iterables.

ELSE CLAUSE
In Python, the "else clause" refers to the part of control structures such as if or loop constructs like for, while, or try used to execute a block of code if the condition associated with the control structure is not met or if the loop completes its execution without any interruption.

In the context of loops such as for, while, or try, the "else clause" will be executed if the loop completes its execution without encountering a break statement. In other words, the "else clause" in a loop is used to execute code when the condition for exiting the loop is not met.

Else after For
Else after While
BREAK
In Python, the break statement is used to halt the execution of a loop (such as for or while) before it is finished. When break is executed, the program exits the loop and continues execution from the line of code after the loop.

CONTINUE
In Python, the continue statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop (such as for or while) and continue to the next iteration. When continue is executed, the remaining code within the loop for the current iteration is skipped, and the loop proceeds with the next iteration.

LIST COMPREHENSION
List comprehension is a concise and efficient way to create lists in Python by iterating over an existing sequence or iterable and applying an expression to each element to create a new list. It provides a more compact syntax compared to traditional loop constructs. Here's a brief explanation of list comprehension:

List comprehension consists of square brackets [], enclosing an expression followed by a for loop within the brackets.
It iterates over elements of an iterable (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and applies the expression to each element to generate a new list.
The resulting list can optionally include conditions (using if statements) to filter elements based on certain criteria.
List comprehension is often used to perform mapping, filtering, and transformation operations on lists.
